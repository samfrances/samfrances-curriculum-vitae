My primary responsibilities revolve around LINX&#39;s role in representing the public policy interests of the Internet industry, especially network operators. However, a high-level understanding of Internet architecture and the TCP/IP protocol suite is essential in order to understand and explain the impact of new policy developments on network operators.

##Education

**M. A. Linguistics**, University College London, *2009 - 2010*


Although linguistics and web development / programming may seem to be unrelated, in fact there are many close parallels. For example, linguistics analyses natural language semantics by way of formal languages such as predicate logic and the lambda calculus. Moreover, the process of modifying a linguistic theory to fit with new data can be compared to that of debugging a piece of software.

* Syntax: 80 (Full marks)
* Issues in Pragmatics: 76 (Distinction)
* Semantics &amp; Pragmatics: 74 (Distinction)
* Foundations of Linguistics: 71 (Distinction)
* Dissertation: 70 (Distinction)
* Interfaces in Syntax: 61
* Phonetics &amp; Phonology: 57
